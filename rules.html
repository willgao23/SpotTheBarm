            Welcome to Spot the Barm! The rules are pretty simple: find Barm and don't let your time run out.
        </div>
        <div>
            Once you start a new game, you'll see a timer start counting down.  That's how much time you have to find Barm.
        Every time you 'spot' Barm by <b>clicking</b> on him, you'll get <b>five more seconds</b> and <b>one point</b> added to your total score. 
        If the timer ever runs out, that's <b>GAME OVER</b>.
        </div>
        <div>
            Happy Barm spotting!
